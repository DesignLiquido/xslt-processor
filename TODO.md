XSLT-processor TODO
=====

* Deal with namespaces (if namespaces are not the same in XSLT and XML document, matches do no occur.)
* XSLT validation
* XSL:number
* `attribute-set`, `decimal-format`, etc. (check `src/xslt.ts`)

Help is much appreciated. It seems to currently work for most of our purposes, but fixes and additions are always welcome!
