	* Version 0.4
	* XPath changes:
	  - Optimize parsing of very common and simple expressions.
	  - Fix use of XPath operator names -- div, mod, and, or -- 
	    as node names in abbreviated step expressions.
	  - Fix root node -- it is now set to ownerDocument.
	* XSLT changes: 
	  - Fix xsl:sort in xsl:for-each.
	* DOM changes:
	  - Add replaceChild(), insertBefore(), removeChild().
	    These are still not needed in XSLT processing, but 
	    in another client of the DOM implementation.
	  - DOM nodes are recycled instead of garbage collected, 
	    in order to improve performance in some browsers.
	* Test changes:
	  - Add many more test cases to the XPath tests.
	  - Add a note mentioning jsunit in the README.
	  - Add a DOM unittest file.

	* Version 0.2
	* Add more missing code
	  - XML parser and simple DOM implementation in dom.js
	  - miscellaneous functions in misc.js.
	* Add simple test pages that serve as examples.
	  - test-xpath.html tests and demonstrates the XPath parser.
	  - test-xslt.html tests and demonstrates the XSLT processor.
	  - output methods for debugging of XPath expressions added
	    in xpathdebug.js.
	* Some additions and corrections in README and TODO
